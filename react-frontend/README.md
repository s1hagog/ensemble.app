# Frontend SPA

This SPA was created with create-react-app

## Setup process

npm i

npm run start

## Testing application

npm run test

### Important notes

This SPA uses my own key for OMDB API. It was possible to put it in .env but i feel like it will be simpler for reviewrs to not worry about making
OMDB accounts. Also this way i could test it faster on different devices.




This app uses port 3000 as a default port
