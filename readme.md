# Ensemble Coding Test

This is a coding test for Ensemble Systems Inc

I have decided to build two projects from the email sent to me. 

## Movie App with React

First project: Movie App with React. It utilizes OMDB API as was required in the instructions email.
The app is capable to retrieve to list of movies based on user search input. Also when clicking on a poster
additional information shows up. 

I added extra flavour to it, a functionality called "Get me a random movie". This function performs a random search, 
and chooses a random movie from the results list. 

The button "Watch later" is not functional. As per instructions list it was not necessary to build functional button. Also 
i wanted to build a backend REST api and not store everything in local storage


## Movies REST API with Express JS

Second project: Its a simple REST API. It supports standarad CRUD operations on Prisma DB which is SQL lite. I did not need to do any SQL code 
because of very proficient abstraction layer Prisma provides. I have decided to go with prisma because it offers very fast and simple out of the box approach. 
You as  a reviewer would have to only run couple Node JS commands and the Rest API will be up and running in a matter of minutes.

This project was mostly demonstrate my ability to build robust APIs. I think validation, documentation and error logging is what differs good software
and great software. The better those areas are, the faster and more productive can developers make features or even complete huge projects.
